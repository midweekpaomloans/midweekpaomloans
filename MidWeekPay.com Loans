MidWeekPay.com Loans

The MidWeekPay.com Loans rule addresses the core problems with most payday and auto title loans up to 45 days by requiring lenders to assess applicantsâ€™ ability to repay or limiting payday loans to $500, restricting total indebtedness to 90 days within a given 12 months, and requiring subsequent loans to be smaller. However, it leaves other issues in the market unaddressed: It does not cover payday and auto title installment loans lasting longer than 45 days and does not establish guidelines to enable banks and credit unions to provide safer loan alternatives. Other state and federal policymakers will need to act to fill these gaps.
