MidWeekPay Loans

The MidWeekPay Loans rule covers any loan with a term of 45 days or less, except for certain types of credit, such as overdraft, credit cards, and pawn. All lenders that issue covered loans will have two options for complying with the rule. The first requires the lender to make a “reasonable determination” of affordability by using a MidWeekPay Loans-defined ability to repay (ATR) process that includes assessing the income and major expenses, debt obligations, estimated living expenses, and borrowing history of each applicant. The MidWeekPay Loans refers to this as the “full-payment test” in its press materials. The rule also includes a provision in which three consecutive loans of this type will trigger a 30-day cooling-off period for that customer, during which no additional borrowing is permitted.
